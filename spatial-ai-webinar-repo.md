Spatial AI is the blending of machine learning inferencing with geometric data from sensors, enabling  robots, drones or autonomous vehicles to better understand the world around them in which they opperate.

This webinar will focus on particular sensor called  a depth camera which enables a developer in their programs to get distance to detected objects and distance between detected objects.  Depth Camera uses stereoscopic depth sensing to calculate distances.  Stereoscopic vision relies on two parallel cameras and the system calculates depth by estimating disparities between matching key-points in the left and right images from the cameras.

1. Navigation and Mapping - Where is my robot and how do I move it around
2. Collision Avoidance - Avoid hitting objects with my robot
3. Scene Understanding - Where are the objects and how are they moving in relation to my robot and each other
4. Object Manipulation - Have a robot perform a task like grasp an object

The alwaysAI API’s support Intel’s latest depth cameras from their Realsense family the D415, D435 and D435i.  All apps within this repo are built on those API’s so you will need a Realsense camera to run them.
